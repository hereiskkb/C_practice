Deposing of null pointers is a feature of C.
null pointers are evaluated to false in logical operations.

Structures
combine fields with different types. 
Use keyword struct
helps you give names to members:

FILE* filePointer;
int bufferLength = 255;
char buffer[bufferLength];

filePointer = fopen("file.txt", "r");

while(fgets(buffer, bufferLength, filePointer)) {
    printf("%s\n", buffer);
}

fclose(filePointer);

Need to check power consumption

powerCon = gammaR * epsilionR

gammaR = (common bits of columns);
epsilionR = (complement);

You have your input

figure out the length of the string

You don't have to make it generic
Just make the counter generic

zeroCounter [ | | | | | ]
oneCounter  [ | | | | | ]

located using a similar process that involves filtering out values until only one 
remains.

from the list
    consider just the first bit



Need to store zero numbers somwhere
Need to store one numbers somewhere

for(i = 1; i < 12; ++) {
    while()
        store zero nums in zeroArray
        store one nums in oneArray

    if(zeroCount > oneCount) {
        use zeroArray to work

    } else {
        use oneArray to work
    }
}

3b : o2 = 3573
     co2 = 1423
