Deposing of null pointers is a feature of C.
null pointers are evaluated to false in logical operations.

Structures
combine fields with different types. 
Use keyword struct
helps you give names to members:

FILE* filePointer;
int bufferLength = 255;
char buffer[bufferLength];

filePointer = fopen("file.txt", "r");

while(fgets(buffer, bufferLength, filePointer)) {
    printf("%s\n", buffer);
}

fclose(filePointer);
